# Colormage

Colormage is a 2D Platformer game where the player's magics are powerful, but their use is limited. 
The player has access to five spells, which take inspiration from the five wedges of mana existing in Magic: The Gathering, my favorite TCG game.


## Disclaimer Alert

* This is my first Unreal Engine project ever.
* The first task was completed on the 06/07/2020, so this is a work in progress. I am currently writing my master's dissertation, don't expect frequent updates.
* Feel free to make suggestions or fork and improve things yourself following the original idea.

I use some free 2D assets downloaded from:

And other assets downloaded from random google search images.

Special effects are mostly free downloads from the official Unreal Engine Marketplace.
